**Fruit image generator, originally made for generating CAPTCHA images**

Generating CAPTCHAs is becoming increasingly complex, and in this project, the idea is to demonstrate how a C-GAN (Composite Generative Adversarial Network) generates new CAPTCHAs using predefined source images.								
																																																																																												
The CNN used for testing the quality of C-GAN generated images is ResNet50. 																																																				
Also, the generated images were tested by humans in a form of a questionnaire, which will be linked shortly.
