# Fruit Image Generator

This project was originally created to generate CAPTCHA images using a **C-GAN (Composite Generative Adversarial Network)**. The goal is to demonstrate how C-GAN generates new CAPTCHA images based on predefined source images.

## Project Overview

Generating CAPTCHA images is becoming increasingly complex. In this project, we use C-GAN to generate new CAPTCHA images, trained on a fruit image dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Testing the Generated Images

To evaluate the quality of the images generated by C-GAN, we used the **ResNet50 CNN** model. Additionally, human testing was conducted through a negative test, linked below.
