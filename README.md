*Fruit Image Generator*
This project was originally designed for generating CAPTCHA images using a C-GAN (Composite Generative Adversarial Network). The goal is to showcase how a C-GAN can generate new CAPTCHA images based on predefined source images.

Project Overview
Generating CAPTCHAs is becoming increasingly complex. In this project, we utilize C-GAN to generate new CAPTCHA images, trained on a fruit dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Testing the Generated Images
To evaluate the quality of the C-GAN generated images, we used the ResNet50 CNN model. Additionally, human evaluation was conducted through a negative test, linked below.
